# Java-Persistent-BTree
A program that crawls 10 predetermined Wikipedia URLs and stores the words/word frequencies for each URL 
in its own persistent BTree. The user enters his/her own wikipedia URL which is also crawled and stored in a BTree.
The similarities of the user's chosen page to the predetermined pages are then computed using 
a cosine similarity metric.
